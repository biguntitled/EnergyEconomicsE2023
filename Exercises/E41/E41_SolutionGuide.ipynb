    "*Ad i)* Electrification is an important strategy in the green transition and refers to the process whereby renewable electricity replaces fossil fuels in the production of goods and services. The heat pump technology is an example of electrification of the heat sector, since renewable electricity is converted into heat to provide heating survices. Note that this should not be confused with use of e.g. solar heating or biomass in the generation of heating services. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ad ii)* The heat pump is also an example of a flexible demand technology in the electricity system in that the marginal willingness to pay is non-constant and electricity demand from heat pumps are increasing in lower electricity prices. Similarly, heat pumps can shut down and reduce electricity demand when electricity costs are prohibitively high. While these features are also present in our simple model, there is an additional flexibility of heat pumps not captured by the model: This additional flexibility of heat pumps comes from the fact that heat is more easily stored. For instance, even if heat prices are low when electricity prices are also low, the generated heat can more easily be stored for when demand for heat is high."
